## 6.1 Overview

> Briefly explain the problem and your solution (1/2 page).

The travelling salesman problem (TSP) allows to find the shortest path by passing to different cities and returning to the start. It can be modeled as a graph problem. The cities are the points of the graph. In this case, there are 14 cities of Republic of the Union of Myanmar with 2 vectors (one with the latitudes and the other with the longitudes). We need to consider than the surface of the Earth is an oblate spheroid, not flat. 

## 6.2 

> Provide the better route you found and the shortest path in kilometers. Is it the optimal shortest path ? explain.

...

## 6.3

> Describe your fitness function

...

## 6.4

> Explain the way you encoded the solution, give a chromosome example.

...

## 6.5

> Provide the configuration of the GA you finally used to find your better results: mutation, crossover, population size, type of selection, mutation, crossover used, number of generations. Describe the methodology or experiments performed in order to get your better results.

...

## 6.6

> Provide relevant plots of your experiments and explanations.

...

## 6.7

> Conclusions (1/2 page) + [optional] eventual supplementary comments (1/2 page)
